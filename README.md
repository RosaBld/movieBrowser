# Movie Browser App with Vite + React

This project is a solo project to go deeper in React and Vite.JS.

The goal of this project was to follow some steps and directions, given by a coach of the courses of BeCode, to go deeper in React through a Movie Browser application by consuming an API Key and a Token.

## What you'll find here

In this App, you'll find a basic Movie Browser Application where you can see a Banner with one of the trending movie, changing with each load. You will also find a list of movies.

When clicking on wathever movie you'd like to see, you will be redirected to a webpage that will give you some informations: synopsis, reviews, genre, movie name and as well a similiar movies that you may find interesting.

When clicking on the genre or one of the genres of the movie, you'll be then redirected to a yet new webpage listing you different movies of that genre.
